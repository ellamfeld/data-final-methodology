    <!-- story -->
<p>For my final data project, I reported on chronic school bus delays in New York City. You can read my final story <a href="https://ellamfeld.github.io/data-final/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>To complete my data analysis, I used the Bus Breakdown and Delays dataset from the Department of Education, published on <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bus-Breakdown-and-Delays/ez4e-fazm/about_data" target="_blank">NYC OpenData</a>.</p>

    <p>The dataset includes every school year from 2015-2016 through now. Each row represents one school bus delay or breakdown. To calculate the total number of delays and breakdowns per school year, I calculated the number of rows each school year had. I excluded the 2024-2025 school year in my value count because it is still ongoing.</p>

    <p>In order to compare this school year to previous ones, I decided to calculate the daily average for the last four school years, including 2024-2025 through May 19, 2025. To do this, I took the total number of delays per school year and divided it by the total number of school days in that school year so far.</p>

    <p>After making that comparison, I focused my calculations on the 2024-2025 school year through May 19, 2025. For my daily average per month chart, I stopped at April, since May is ongoing.</p>

    <p>This data analysis will be better after June 26, 2025, when all the data for the 2024-2025 school year has been collected. I plan to re-analyze the numbers then. Still, by using the average number of delays per day as my primary metric, I believe my data analysis is as accurate and fair as it can be today.</p>
